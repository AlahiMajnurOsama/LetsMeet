<br>

The Challenge
------------
-------
Build a Microsoft Teams clone.

The solution should be a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other using the product to have a video conversation.

Running the Web App on your Local Device
--------------------------------
--------------------------------
To run the web app in your local device, run the following commands in your terminal (macOS) or command prompt (Windows) :-

-Clone the GitHub repository into your local device by running the following command:
```bash
cd folder-you-want-to-download-code-in

git clone https://github.com/shrutayyyy/LetsMeet.git

cd LetsMeet
```
-Now that you're in the project folder, open terminal to download the needed node modules:
```bash
npm install
```
-Now run the server by running the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
-To access the web app, in your project code folder, navigate to public/landing-page and from there open landing.html on any browser of your preference (Chrome recommended for best experience).
